🚀 Vision AI Object Detector (GroundingDINO – Realtime, CPU)

A realtime object detection system built using GroundingDINO and OpenCV, optimized to run on CPU-only environments without requiring any paid APIs or cloud services.


This project performs prompt-based object detection directly from a webcam feed, allowing users to specify objects in natural language (e.g., "person, dog, mobile phone").

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python 3.10
GroundingDINO
PyTorch (CPU)
OpenCV
TorchVision
NumPy
